## Project 2 Narrative Visualization
 <br>
### Prospectus
 <br>
- [ ] Mockups, Architecture, Final Data Due: Dec. 2, 2020
Due Date: Dec. 16, 2020

 <br>
 A more complex, though more subjective, role of the information designer is to use our skills of presenting data to supplement a narrative. In this project, you will expand on the skills learned in the tutorials and the exploratory project to present a narrative, supported with both text and graphics.
 <br>
 These data visualizations typically:

Present a story or argument, with visualizations to supplement your position<br>
Use multiple small visualizations to expose parts of a series, in a curated order<br>
The story becomes the primary driver of experience, explicitly drawing attention to what the user should pay attention to <br>
<br>
This project is not intended to be an exercise in data science or analysis, rather, an exploration in visual communication. Since data insights are often hard to come by, you may leverage data or insight from other researchers or used in other classes and submit your take on the story (of course, properly citing your sources).
 <br>
 **Requirements and Grade Criteria**:
 <br> 
 <br>
• Visualization should effectively communicate an insight or narrative <br>
• Graph types should be appropriate for the data they represent <br>
• Graphs are intentionally designed and professionally produced <br>
• Visualizations synthesize the skills taught in class, which could include any combination of chart types, graphical primitives, data management and UI elements <br>
• Visualizations must make clear what data is represented (this may include annotations, axes, proper labeling, citations, etc.) <br>
• Data presented is factual (as well as any analysis or manipulations) <br>
• Data sources must be referenced <br>
• Code should be clean, readable, and commented where appropriate <br>
• Design process deliverables completed and submitted on time <br>

Data: personal history from Spotify (she could get it easily) <br>
But, she needs global data from general public (US users) <br>
NYC vs. LA Comparison <br>
 <br>
Smaller numbers of variables (demographics, weather factor - summer vs. winter) <br>
 <br>
Perspective: (dis)proving your assumption in terms of dissimilar trends if any. <br>
Is there any big difference between east vs. west coasts in people's musical trend <br>
 <br>
Audience: advertiser, marketer, music industry, singers, artist, personal interest <br>
 <br>
Topic: I'm visualizing the music trends of LA & NYC <br>
